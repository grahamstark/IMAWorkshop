# IMAWorkshop

Code for the 2024 IMA Conference Julia Workshop

## Instructions

It would be nice if you could have a go at installing Julia ahead of the workshop as it'll save us a wee while. Installing the packages would also be good as an admitted problem with Julia is that [first time loading packages is sometimes slow](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/taking-ttfx-seriously-can-we-make-common-packages-faster-to-load-and-use/74949?page=2).

### Installing Julia

We'll be using the latest Julia 1.10, downloadable from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
